# Controllers

This is generated by Beego framework after running `bee new seagul`. There're controllers of back-end server which are responsible for rendering a HTML file or processing API requests.

## Default.go

This is generated to render a simple page to the browser. We keep it because we use Beego as a web server.

But this is quite simple when we use AngularJS as the front-end framework. The MainController in default.go just needs to render one HTML file in the whole website.

Here's almost all the code of it.

```
func (this *MainController) Get() {
  this.TplNames = "index.html"
  this.Render()
}
```

## Dockerapi.go

This is another controller for seagull to process API request about docker.

It will not render a whole HTML file and just return JSON data or pure string.

The code of Dockerapi.go is as simple as the previous one.

```
/* Wrap docker remote API to get version info */
func (this *DockerapiController) GetVersion() {
  address := "/version"
  result := RequestUnixSocket(address, "GET")
  this.Ctx.WriteString(result)
}
```

Then the front-end framework or other processes and get the data from thess APIs.
